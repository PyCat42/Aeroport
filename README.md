# Aeroport
Get number of seats on all available flights to desired city.

This program loads two databases, one with data about the available flights and the other with planes with the number of seats on each. (Examples are given in .txt files)

The user enters the desired city, and the program returns the number of available seats on all the planes to the entered destination. If the destination is not in the base, the program throws a KeyError and notifies the user.

**Note:** If needed use absolute paths when loading data files.
